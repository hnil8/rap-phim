6. Depth & Elevation

| Level | Treatment | Use |
|-------|-----------|-----|
| Flat (Level 0) | No shadow, no border | Everything — the dominant state |
| Bordered (Level 1) | `1px solid #27272a` | Alert containers only |
| Dark Section (Level 2) | Dark bg (#000000 / #1a1a1a) with light text | Hero, features, footer |
| Light Section (Level 3) | White/Cool Cloud bg with dark text | Content sections, research |

**Shadow Philosophy**: Runway uses **zero shadows**. This is a film-production design decision — in cinema, depth comes from lighting, focus, and composition, not drop shadows. The interface mirrors this philosophy: depth is communicated through dark/light section alternation, photographic depth-of-field, and overlay transparency — never through CSS box-shadow.
